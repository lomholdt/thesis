\section{Classroom Response System for IT}

We have created a high-fidelity prototype of a system that supports the features discussed in the previous section. We call it CRSFIT, which is an abbreviation of Classroom Response System For IT. The system includes features that support asking and answering technical questions\footnote{Here we've defined technical questions as questions that can display formatted code and mathematical expressions.}. Here we'll give an explanation of how to use the system and how the different parts fit together.

The first part of this section will give an explanation of how the system works and briefly describe how to use it. The description should give the reader an overview of the different parts and how they fit together.

The next part of this section will give a detailed technical description of how the system is build and structured. This part goes into detail about how Django is used to model the system and which third-party libraries the system relies on. Furthermore, we will describe how the system is deployed. The system is available online at \url{http://crsfit.online}.
