\section{Method}



The idea of Classroom Responses Systems is not a new one. As mentioned, early analog versions of these systems where used where students simply raised a card with their answer \cite[p.~257]{stowell2007benefits}. Several examples of such systems in more moderns versions have been shown, and such we must determine where our system lies from a strategic standpoint. To find this out we have used our own interpretation of \emph{Porters Five Forces} \cite{porter1979competitive}.

Furthermore, we have designed a test based on previous tests of response systems with the purpose of finding out if the systems is able to increase interaction in class. The test and the design of the test will be described in detail in this section.




\subsection{Porters Five Forces}
The model shows how competition can be seen as five forces. 

\emph{The threat of new entrants}, how new entrants to an industry have a desire to gain market share. \emph{The bargaining power of suppliers}, the dynamics of suppliers changing prices and capturing more value for themselves. \emph{The bargaining power of buyers}, the fact that buyers can demand more value by forcing down prices or wanting better quality. \emph{The threat of substitues}, other products on the market offering the same or better products by different means. For example using ITU's own system, LearnIT, with a native question feature instead of using a dedicated CRS. And finally, the fact that other systems compete for market share already, for example by introducing new features or discounted pricing. Figure \ref{fig:porter5forces} shows a depiction of the model as it is explained in \citeA[p.~141]{porter1979competitive}.

All forces must be taken into consideration when evaluating the strategic position to ensure our systems sustainability \todo{Find other word for this?} in a challenging market. 
In the following section, we will walk through each of the five forces, describing their meaning and properties.
%In the following section we will determine how these forces can be interpreted against our system, and essentially against our strategy.

An important notice is, that the amount of fully digital CRS systems are manyfold. The ones that we mention here is merely the ones that we were able to find during our research. Arguably there might me more, but we will only be concerned about the ones mentioned here. 


\subsubsection{Threat of new entrants}
The first force, the threat of new entrants, is primarily focused around the seven entry barriers, that incumbents have relative to new entrants, as explained by \citeA{porter2008five}.

The first barrier is \emph{supply-side economies of scale}. Essentially it covers the fact that the larger volumes, creates lower cost per unit. This is essentially true, due to the fact that a unit in our sense is users, and our cost per unit is server maintenance cost, the more users, the more servers but also spread fixed costs. For entrants though, the cost can be low and may simply scale as the business expands.

The \emph{demand-side benefits of scale}, is the fact that users might have increased willingness to buy a product if other buyers patronize the company. Users may also value being part of a bigger \emph{network}, thus this barrier is also known as the \emph{network effect} \cite[p.~81]{porter2008five}. It's hard to counter the fact that a huge volume will have a positive effect on almost any platform, but in general with CRS systems, it would seem plausible that systems are chosen based on user needs. This leads us naturally towards the third barrier \emph{customer switching costs}. The name is mostly self explanatory, but this barrier regards the switching cost to a new system. If we only consider web based systems, which most of the modern ones are, most users does not have any deep data affiliation with the systems, so switching comes at almost no cost. For entrants this is very positive. Given that gaining traction on such a market is very much possible if the system is feature competitive.

\emph{Capital requirements} consider the fact that the \emph{"need to invest large financial resources in order to compete can deter new entrants"} \cite[p.~81]{porter2008five}. In the case of CRS, it should be possible to build such a system without great capital requirements. In fact a working prototype can be made ready very quickly, as our example shows, thou this is also a threat once you are in the market, potential entrants can be plentiful.

\emph{Incumbency advantages independent of size} take into consideration the fact, that almost any incumbents has the advantage of already being available on the market \cite[p.~81]{porter2008five}. Simply put, being first can have potential advantages. Even though this might seem obvious, it is important to remember while analysing the CRS market. It would seem that many have tried (referring to the many systems mentioned here), and many also appears well established, but none seem to be dominant and.

Entrants and incumbents might have \emph{unequal access to distribution channels}. For entrants, distribution channels must be secured in order to be able to displace others from the market. While dealing with non-physical products, and in this case dealing with software where the "shelf space" is unlimited, the distribution channels  comes down to marketing of the product. Everybody has equal ability to market their product (online for example), but here the capital requirements might come in to play, since marketing can be a costly affair, and the distribution channels depend on it.

The final barrier is \emph{restrictive government policy}. It concerns the fact that the government might have direct influence on whether you will be able to even become an entrant on the market \cite[p.~82]{porter2008five}. Gathering potential licenses or other restrictions that might apply from a government level should be considered. While handling digital systems, laws governing privacy and data security should also be dealt with, though most CRS does not handle much user data beside an email or username and a password which is also the case in our system.

\subsubsection{Bargaining power of suppliers}
The next force is the \emph{bargaining power of suppliers}. This is concerned with the fact that powerful suppliers are able to manipulate different metrics to capture more value for themselves \cite[p.~82]{porter2008five}. This could be done by charging more for their product or limiting quality. \citeA{porter2008five} explains how Microsoft has contributed to the profitability of personal computers, and have been able to increase the price of their operating systems as an example of this force.

Even though this force is extremely relevant for the strategic planning of an entrant, the fact that our CRS is fully web based software, the supplier group that we are concerned about is less relevant. In our case we are primarily interested in hosting and data-storage, and the market for this is very versatile. One consideration though might be that once a supplier has been chosen, the switching cost is high, due to the fact that it would be necessary to move all the data. Depending on the company's data history policy this could become the largest consideration in terms of bargaining power of suppliers.

\subsubsection{Bargaining power of buyers}
The next force is the \emph{bargaining power of buyers}. It is essentially the opposite of the \emph{bargaining power of suppliers} \cite[p.~83]{porter2008five}. Here buyers are able to force \emph{down} prices, demand \emph{better} quality etc. According to \citeA{porter2008five}, a customer group has negotiating power if they meet the listed criteria. For example, if there are only a few buyers or each buyer tends to buy in large volumes, as it is the case in the chemical industry \cite[p.~83]{porter2008five}. Also if a product is very standardized, buyers might find an equivalent product at another vendor, and if the switching cost is low, it might result in loosing buyers loyalty. 
On the other hand buyers are more price sensitive if for example the quality of the product is not affecting the buyers end product. Basically this means that if the product being bought is of high value for the customers outcome, the price tends to be of little concern \cite[p.~84]{porter2008five}. Also if the buyers earn low profits from the product, they are more attentive to prices. In contrast cash-rich buyers might care less. In relation, if the product has little effect on the buyers he might care less. \citeA{porter2008five}'s example of this, is within investment banking for example. You do not want to find the cheapest alternative when you want to invest money if it reflects the resulting outcome. In short \emph{"consumers tend to be more price sensitive if they are purchasing products that are undifferentiated, expensive relative to their incomes, and of a sort where product performance has limited consequences"} \cite[p.~84]{porter2008five}.

\subsubsection{Threat of substitute products or services}
A substitute is a product, that serves the same or similar purpose as the original product, but by different means \cite[p.~84]{porter2008five}. Some of \citeA{porter2008five}'s own examples are videoconferencing that is a substitute for travel and e-mail that is a substitute for regular mail. 

% In our case a CRS is (or could be) a substitute for hand-raising.

The thread of substitution will be high if \emph{it offers an attractive price-performance trade-off to the industry's product} \cite[p.~84]{porter2008five}. In layman's terms the product should be competitive on price, compared to it's performance. Also if the buyers switching cost to a substitute product is low, the threat is high \cite[p.~84]{porter2008five}.

\subsection{Rivalry among existing competitors}
The last and final force is the rivalry among existing competitors. Existing industry have to be competitive to survive, and doing discounts and adding new products to their product-portfolio is an important dimension \cite[p.~85]{porter2008five}. In general intense rivalry drives down an industry's potential profit based on number of competitors and their size, industry growth rates, exit barriers and rivals commitment \cite[p.~85]{porter2008five}. 

In the sections above, we have shown the essence of Porters five forces, and what the model looks like. We have walked through each of the forces individually, and come with small examples for each, in order to be able to apply the model in the following sections.  


































\subsection{Test of CRSFIT and design of the test}
We have designed a test in order to tell whether or not our solution can have an impact on teaching classes that covers teaching programming and mathematics. The test is highly inspired by \cite{siau2006use} and their work. \citeA{siau2006use} found that there wasn't developed any instrument for measuring interactivity so they made there own which we intend to borrow elements from.

The test is designed to tell whether or not we are able to move peoples behaviour, beliefs and attitude towards engagement, interactivity and participation during class. \citeA{siau2006use} defined a test design consisting of a \emph{pretest}, \emph{implementation} (of the system in a class) and a \emph{posttest} followed up by a \emph{qualitative data collection} doing exactly this. Our test is structured in the same way and we are asking similar questions in the different parts of the test as well. The whole test should preferably be carried out over a whole semester, but due to the limited time of this project the test will be carried out in a single lecture. The pretest and posttest are made as questionnaires. 

By having a pretest and a posttest asking the same questions we'll be able to compare the results and measure whether or not we are able to move peoples attitude. The pretest consists of two parts which are asking about individual interactivity and general interactivity in the class. The questions in the first part of the pretest (individual) are formulated as statements such as \emph{"I am engaged in class."} and \emph{"I provide my opinion to questions from the teacher during the class."}. In the second part of the pretest (general) we will ask students to answer similar statements such as \emph{"Students participate in class discussion."} and \emph{"Students receive feedback in class on their understanding of the course materials."}. The pretest should be answered by students before or in the beginning of the given lecture in which the test is carried out. See appendix \ref{app:pretest} for a complete list of the questions from the pretest questionnaire.

During the lecture, we will ask students questions relevant to their class with our solution, CRSFIT. This part of the test is the \emph{implementation}. Students will answer these questions anonymously and they will not be held accountable for their answers. The purpose of this part of the test is to 1) tell if students actually benefit from using the system and overall find it useful and 2) test our solution in a real setting.

It requires training and experience to get the most out of a classroom response system. The literature and comments about how to use response systems in a beneficial way has developed alongside with the research of the implementation of response system in classrooms. For example, see: \cite{lantz2014effectiveness,draper2004increasing,lin2011implementing} for insights and comments about how to effectively use response systems. Therefore we will help creating questions which can be asked during the lecture in which we carry out our test.

In the posttest questionnaire we will ask students to answer the same questions as in the pretest questionnaire in order to tell if they feel different about their individual interactivity and the general interactivity in the class. Furthermore, we will ask students about the ease of use of CRSFIT and the perceived usefulness. The \emph{ease of use} is included in order to get feedback on how easy the system is to use. This should give us a clear impression since no participants have seen or used the system prior to the test. The \emph{perceived usefulness} asks into the idea of the system with statements like \emph{"Using the system makes it easier for me to interact in the class."} to be rated. Included in the posttest questionnaire is also an open ended question in which we ask students to give their opinion about advantages and disadvantages of using a classroom response system. This is the qualitative part of the test. This part serves to give us an idea about if there are areas that this kind of system does particular good or bad. See appendix \ref{app:posttest} for a complete list of the questions from the posttest questionnaire.

The pretest and the posttest are designed as questionnaires. Questionnaires makes the least demands on personal and social skills of the questioner \cite[p.~74]{deacon2007researching} and enables us to measure the results. The questionnaires are to be answered online with Google Forms. Our way of asking the questions are highly structured since they are written down and asked in the exact same way to all respondents \cite[p.~65]{deacon2007researching}. Both questionnaires can be found in the appendix (\ref{app:pretest}, \ref{app:posttest}).

When asking questions in a questionnaire (or in general) the questioner should be aware which type of questions are asked. What does the question seek to find information about? \citeA[pp.~80-84]{dillman1978mail} lists four types of questions which are asking into either \emph{behaviour}, \emph{beliefs}, \emph{attitudes} or \emph{attributes}. With our questions we are interested in behaviour, beliefs and attitudes. We are not focusing on attributes. Questions asking into attributes are concerned about background information of the respondent such as age, gender etc \cite[p.~75]{deacon2007researching}. While these questions typically are easy to answer, they are of no interest to us. They are often used to say something about a group of people you don't know and are of most use in very large samples. Our questions are interested in behaviour when we ask student to rate statements such as \emph{"I interact with the teacher in class."} and beliefs (\emph{"Students receive feedback from the teacher during the class."}) and attitudes (\emph{"I find the system useful in enhancing my interaction in the class."}).

It may seem that some of our questions are identical to each other even though they are slightly different. Because of this we risk that respondents doesn't see the difference from the previous question and therefore may answer the same as in the previous question. This doesn't matter much as long as we see a change in the values from the pretest to the posttest. However, we could also risk that respondents find the questionnaire as a whole to be frustrating or difficult to answer though.

All of the questions in our questionnaires (except one) are formulated as statements which should be answered on a Likert scale\footnote{We will use the term scale and not item as discussed in some literature.} \cite{likert1932technique} from 1-9 where 1 is \emph{Strongly disagree} and 9 is \emph{Strongly agree}. With an uneven number we offer a neutral choice (5 on the scale) in order to avoid forcing an opinion on the respondents. These choices are taken with measuring differences in the results in mind. We could alternatively have made respondents answer on a scale from 1-5 or 1-4. Chances are though, that we are not able to move peoples attitude enough for it to be measurable. However, with a finer scale we might be able to measure significant differences in attitude towards the statements as suggested by \citeA{matell1972there}.
