\subsection{The optimal setup and test}
Given the time, we would have done our testing differently. In order to tell if our system could increase interactivity in courses where programming or mathematics are taught we should have done further and different testing. A single test would normally be done during a whole semester. The pretest should be done in the beginning or few weeks into the course to establish base results which the implementation of the CRS should aim to improve. The posttest should be done in the ending of the semester and it should ask the same questions concerning individual and general questions as the pretest did.

While we were given half an hour in a single lecture to do the pretest, implementation and posttest it wouldn't make sense to ask the participants to answer the same questions in the pre- and posttest. If we did that any significant differences found would be irrelevant due to the short time they had to use the system. Furthermore, the setting was not a normal lecture as we carried out the the "implementation" asking 10 questions in a row. The optimal setting would be normal lectures where the teacher responsible for the course asked the students one or two questions related to the lecture's subject and at suitable moments. The systems should ultimately be used over a longer period of time before we would be able to say if it could increase the interaction.



Punkter til discussion:
- Gentag eskperiment/undersøgelse over et helt semester
	- "Due to limited time for this project..."
	- Sammenlign pre med post hvor man spørger ind til individual og general interactivity igen
- Antallet af respondenter
- Måden testen blev udført på
- Vores reelle konkurrencedygtighed (Porter)
    - Prototype kontra færdigt produkt 
- Undersøg dybere med kode/math
- We've created an instrument for measuring our system
    - Which we've tested
    

- Vi undersøger ikke kode/math-delen som vi måske gerne ville have gjort for at sige noget om dét.
    - "Did you find it easy to answer questions which include code?"
        - Det kunne måske have været brugt til at sammenligne noget.
