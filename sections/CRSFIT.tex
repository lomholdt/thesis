The first part of this section will give an explanation of how the system works and briefly describe how to use it. The description should give the reader an overview of the different parts and how they fit together.

The next part of this section will give a detailed technical description of how the system is build and structured. This part goes into detail about how Django is used to model the system and which third-parties the system relies on. Furthermore, we will describe how the system is deployed and the architecture behind it.
