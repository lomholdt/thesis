\begin{abstract}
Classroom Response Systems (CRS) has been found able to increase learning outcome, but only little research has been made specifically for IT classrooms. We have implemented a CRS that is able to show code formatted correctly with syntax highlighting, and is able to display mathematical notation, called CRSFIT. We tested two systems in two classes, one using a CRS called Mentimeter, another using CRSFIT. Each class answered a pretest, used the CRS and answered the posttest. Our test of the systems shows that students find their interaction increased by using such a system, but the results are inadequate to show if an increased learning outcome has been achieved by using CRSFIT.
