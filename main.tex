\begin{abstract}
%Classroom Response Systems (CRS) has been found able to increase learning outcome, but only little research has been made specifically for IT classrooms. We have implemented a CRS, called CRSFIT, that is able to show code formatted correctly with syntax highlighting and display mathematical notation. We tested two systems in two classes, one using a CRS called Mentimeter, another using CRSFIT. Each class answered a pretest, used the CRS and answered the posttest. Our test of the systems shows that students find their interaction increased by using such a system, but the results are inadequate to show if an increased learning outcome has been achieved by using CRSFIT.

Classroom Response Systems (CRS) have been found able to increase learning outcome while only little research has been conducted on CRSs for IT classrooms. In this thesis we have developed a CRS for IT (CRSFIT) that allows correct formatting of code with syntax highlighting and display of mathematical notation. In addition to a test of CRSFIT we tested a CRS called Mentimeter in an IT classroom. Each class participating in the tests answered a pretest, used Mentimeter or CRSFIT, and answered a posttest. The students reported an increased interaction in class after using Mentimeter and CRSFIT, respectively. Although our results show that interaction in class is increased when using CRSFIT more testing is required to determine if the use of CRSFIT significantly enhances in-class participation and learning outcome.
